# Project-1
For my first project a created a math game.  The goal is to answer 10 math questions correctly and avoid making three mistakes.  

The computer will generate an arithmatic problem, and the user needs to type the answer in the game.  If that answer is correct it will count towards the set goal of 10 correct answers.  If the user makes three mistakes the game will stop.

Created in .vscode and containing 1 html file 
                                  1 .js  file
                                  1 .css file

To play, dowload the entire file and launch it in you borwser. Preferably Google Chrome.

                    MVP GOALS
As a player, I want to type a number to answer a math question correctly.

As a player, I want clear controls so its easy to navigate. (even though there won't be too many controls needed)  

As a player, I want the game to keep track of questions answered correctly and the ones I answer wrong. 

As a player, I want the option to restart at the end of a game/round.

As a player, I want the graphic to increase when I'm correct and decrease if I'm wrong.

// As a player, I want to be able to choose different colored backgrounds to select my favorite color.
//As a player, I want a timer to show me how long a game/round lasts.

Major Hurdles
*javascript - figuring out the needed functions
              the restart function

*html - divs vs classes vs id 

*css - alll of it, but I'm proud of where it ended up


UNSOLVED ISSUES


* I couldn't figure out how to get division to be one of the operations with out it messing the up the game's code.
